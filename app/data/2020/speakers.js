I currently work as a Senior Cloud Developer AdvocateðŸ¥‘ at Microsoft. I was also a Developer Advocate for 2 years at Cloudinary before joining Microsoft.
    Before becoming an advocate, I loved working as a consultant. I consulted as a Software Developer, Developer Advocate, Technical Writer and Community Champion for startups including Scotch.io, Auth0, Pusher, Cloudinary, Progress, deepstreamHub, Logrocket, Dialog Engineers, Manifold, etc.
    I love working with the developer communities to build an ecosystem. With forces from colleagues and friends we built communities like forLoop Africa, Angular Nigeria, Concatenate Conference, Me.io, Frontstack.io and a lot more. I am responsible for expanding the forLoop Africa communities across new African countries and ecosystems while trying my best to sustain the existing ones.`,

        'Service workers give us access to the browser cache through the self.caches API. This gives you the arsenal of tools you need to go offline. What is uncommonly seen though is that you can access the cache API in the browser (not just through SW). You can do that using window.cache which is useful for progressively building a progressive web app.',

    She believes the trifecta of accessibility, performance, and inclusion can work symbiotically to improve our social landscape digitally and physically. When ethically-minded, she thinks technologists can dismantle exclusionary systems in favour of community-focused, inclusive ones.
    Never totally pleased with design tools, she designs in browser to bring performant, semantic, and accessible visual narratives into the web. Her current obsessions are optimising variable fonts, converting raster images into to SVGs, and recreating modernist paintings in CSS grid. When she can successfully escape vim, she finds new countries to explore (33 and counting).`,

In praxis, we often use the term to dismiss a use case's relevance to the broader success of our product or service. But edge cases can be portals to safety leaks, unserved populations, and unconsidered journeys. By centring edge cases in our process and examining what they can tell us, we can work towards more ethical, inclusive, and considered products.`,

      title: 'Automating Your Vulnerabilities Away',
      description: `Your production Node.js applications are insecure. These vulnerabilities aren't coming from the module ecosystem, as you may expect â€“ they're coming from your own engineering practices. Node.js versions are the root cause of vulnerabilities in production that your team isn't managing effectively. But, there's a light at the end of the tunnel â€“ that light is automation. The Node.js project actively ships updates often and with notice, and does their best to effectively communicate the changes that specifically revolve around security releases. Nevertheless, your Node.js versions are a few releases behind because your app _works_ regardless of the Node.js version that's running â€“ as such, upgrading is a lower priority than literally anything else you could possibly be doing. In this talk you'll learn about the resources that are currently available to help you and your ops team keep your Node.js versions up to date, covering your apps from being attacked with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.`,

        'Static sites have made a comeback as of late. This "return to simplicity" is unsurprising given the current complexity of websites and applications that make maintenance quite the nightmare. Regardless, static sites today are a far cry from their older counterparts. Static sites circa early 2000s consisted of static markup with some CSS thrown in for flavor. Today, static sites are much more dynamic and are a healthy mix of JavaScript, APIs and Markup, aka JAM. They are capable of more complex behavior like processing payments and making authentication requests that are traditionally associated with backend server logic. In this talk, letâ€™s dive into the wonderful world of the JAMstack and how we can harness it to make faster, more secure websites and applications.',

        <p>Performance is fundamentally, a UX concern. Sites that are slow to render or janky to interact with are a bad user experience. We strive to write performant code for our users, but users donâ€™t directly interact with our code - it all happens through the medium of the browser. The browser is the middleman between us and our users; therefore to make our users happy, we first have to make the browser happy. But how exactly do we do that?</p>
        <p>In this talk, weâ€™ll learn how browsers work under the hood: how they request, construct, and render a website. At each step along the way, weâ€™ll cover what we can do as developers to make the browserâ€™s job easier, and why those best practices work. Youâ€™ll leave with a solid understanding of how to write code that works *with* the browser, not against it, and ultimately improves your usersâ€™ experience.</p>
