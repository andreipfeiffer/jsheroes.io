I currently work as a Senior Cloud Developer AdvocateðŸ¥‘ at Microsoft. I was also a Developer Advocate for 2 years at Cloudinary before joining Microsoft.
  //   Before becoming an advocate, I loved working as a consultant. I consulted as a Software Developer, Developer Advocate, Technical Writer and Community Champion for startups including Scotch.io, Auth0, Pusher, Cloudinary, Progress, deepstreamHub, Logrocket, Dialog Engineers, Manifold, etc.
  //   I love working with the developer communities to build an ecosystem. With forces from colleagues and friends we built communities like forLoop Africa, Angular Nigeria, Concatenate Conference, Me.io, Frontstack.io and a lot more. I am responsible for expanding the forLoop Africa communities across new African countries and ecosystems while trying my best to sustain the existing ones.`,

What is uncommonly seen though is that you can access the cache API in the browser (not just through SW). You can do that using window.cache which is useful for progressively building a progressive web app.",
