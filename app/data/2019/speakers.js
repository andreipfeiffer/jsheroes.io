Others don’t bother because the documentation isn’t good enough and there aren’t enough learning resources. If the project survives, then over time developers will chip away at these problems, but it’s often hard to convince people to shake their initial impression. React Native is no different from other tools in this regard, so I want to present a few reasons why you might want to give React Native a(nother) try now, nearly three years since its initial release.',

  //       <p>Starting from scratch, we will implement several common mobile UI patterns that depend on gestures and/or animations so that you can become comfortable with React Native's "Animated" API (which also works on the web!) and react-native-gesture-handler. Even if you don't have a use case for React Native, this may be useful to generally learn more about gestures and animations. We will use create-react-native-app, or if you prefer to not install anything, you can use https://snack.expo.io directly from your browser.</p>
