        At JSHeroes,<strong> we strive for an inclusive and diverse community</strong>. This has
        determined us over the years to put together a diversity program in order to help
        underrepresented groups in tech to attend this community event. This includes but isnâ€™t
        limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled people.

        The ticket includes{' '}
        <strong>
          admission to the conference (11-12 April), catering for the day of the conference, coffee
          breaks and admission to the parties organised for the conference attendees
        </strong>
        . All attendees, speakers, sponsors and staff at JSHeroes 2019 are required to agree with
