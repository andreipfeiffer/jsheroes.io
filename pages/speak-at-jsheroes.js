          What we are looking for
        </h2>
        <p>
          JSHeroes is a <strong>single track 2-day conference</strong> dedicated to the JS and Web
          ecosystems. We are looking for a multitude of topics and perspectives, but most of all we
          value:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Original</strong> topics, presented for the first time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practical</strong> ideas that attendees can apply at work the next day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trends and hot topics which are relevant in <strong>2020</strong> and beyond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fresh <strong>perspectives</strong> on the JS ecosystem.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>human</strong> side of software engineering.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will do our best to build an <strong>agenda</strong> that covers{' '}
          <strong>diverse</strong> topics which can be of interest for the majority of attendees
          interested in the current landscape of the JavaScript world. We do not wish to limit your
          perspectives, but we did propose a couple of <strong>broad topics</strong> in the CFP
          form, in which your proposal may fall. However, do not consider them restrictive, but
          rather see them as a guideline to classify and structure all the proposals we receive.

          How the selection will happen
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are expecting to receive over <strong>300 proposals</strong> for JSHeroes 2020. With
          this in mind, we created a team of world wide subject matter experts that will go through
          the proposals and will decide what to include on the final agenda. This is a rough
          estimation of our schedule and process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All the proposals are to be received until <strong>December 21st</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each member of the commitee will go through the proposals and will create their own{' '}
            <strong>shortlist</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on the recurrence of a proposal on multiple shortlists we will proceed to place it
            on the <strong>accepted</strong> list.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>debate</strong> and <strong>selection</strong> process for the remaining
            proposals will end in <strong>January</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the speakers will get a <strong>response</strong>, positive or negative, at the the{' '}
            <strong>beginning of February</strong>.
